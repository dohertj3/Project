check_ising.cc is the function which uses SFCs to parallelise the Ising model
It takes in the following flags
n - number of steps
m - size of lattice
t - temperature of lattice
p - prints results in a format readable by plotting functions
c - returns timings of each function

--------Compiler prerequisites and how to run--------------
Latest version of gcc required
must load openmpi

use mpirun to run script, for example

mpirun -n 8 ./ising -n 1000 -m 32 -t 2.25 

n - flag used to decide how many processors to use

-------------other files-------------
./ising - the executable which must be run

nproc128.sh  - creates timings for a number of different sizes of processors for matrix size 128
nproc64.sh  - creates timings for a number of different sizes of processors for matrix size 64
nproc32.sh  - creates timings for a number of different sizes of processors for matrix size 32
nproc16.sh  - creates timings for a number of different sizes of processors for matrix size 16
nproc8.sh  - creates timings for a number of different sizes of processors for matrix size 8

temp.sh - gets the magnetisation of the lattice for a number of different temperatures
